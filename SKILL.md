description: Use the ItPay CLI when a human asks an AI agent to discover, compare, buy, pay for, resume, receive, inspect, or refund verified third-party services through ItPay. Trigger on mentions of ItPay, paid APIs, specialist data, compliance research, digital goods, checkout, payment, order, receipt, refund help, or requests to use a verified service instead of ordinary web search.

# ItPay Buyer

Use the CLI as the only ItPay control surface. Do not recreate API calls or hardcode a service-specific sequence.

## Critical Rules

- Keep one honest Agent Type, one CLI/Node launcher, and one Host-approved permission context for the whole flow.
- Treat `next.command` as the preferred continuation, not an unconditional command. If the current result already satisfies the user's stated goal, present it and stop.
- Keep internal parsing, retries, sandbox diagnosis, and command translation out of the user response; report useful progress, results, and real human decisions only.
- If Device state is not writable, stop. Do not switch Node, manually create lock files, delete identity, or rotate Agent Type.

## Bootstrap

If the `itpay` command is unavailable, ask before installing the official CLI:

```bash
npm install -g @itpay/cli
```

Then initialize the selected runtime:

```bash
itpay readyz --json
itpay skill show itpay-buyer --json
itpay install --json
itpay install <agent_type> --json
itpay --agent-type <agent_type> readyz --json
```

Follow each returned `next.command`. `readyz` deliberately points back to this complete Skill. If the Skill was read without an Agent Type, choose the real runtime with `install`; after typed `readyz`, read the Skill again and continue to Catalog.

Supported types are `codex-desktop`, `codex-cli`, `claude-code-desktop`, `claude-code-cli`, and `workbuddy`. State the real stable runtime type honestly. Do not identify a window, chat, task, process, or model session as a new Agent.

## Identity And Sessions

- One local Ed25519 private key represents this ItPay installation. Never expose, copy, or rotate it to recover quota.
- Device registrations are scoped by exact Backend API base URL. `dev`, `test`, and `app` therefore have separate server device IDs, quota lineage, Agent instances, and sessions while using the same local key.
- Each Backend registration has one Agent Instance per `agent_type`. Different windows and chats of the same type reuse it; different types get separate instances under that registration.
- Every commerce command must keep the explicit `--agent-type` returned in `next` and `recovery`, or use one stable `ITPAY_AGENT_TYPE`. Never fall back to another type previously used on the machine.
- The CLI renews an expired or rejected device session and retries the same request exactly once. If that retry still fails, stop and report it; do not loop, create a new identity, or switch Agent Type.
- A revoked v2 device is not replaced automatically. It requires an explicit operator recovery path.
- If an operator confirms that one Backend registration database was reset, use `device recover --confirm-backend-reset` for that selected Backend only. This preserves the private key and every other Backend registration; never use it for ordinary session expiry or revocation.
- `--host` selects presentation. `--target` is only the destination chat/channel/open ID required by some Hosts. Neither is business input or identity.

## Envelope Rule

For every JSON response:

1. Read `status` and `result` as current facts.
2. Follow `instruction` when explaining or presenting those facts.
3. Execute at most the one `next.command`, filling only explicit placeholders or required user data.
4. Use `recovery` only when the normal next step cannot continue.

Do not print the whole envelope to the user. Return the useful result, a short explanation, and the next human action when needed.

## Golden Flow

```bash
itpay --agent-type <agent_type> catalog list --json
itpay --agent-type <agent_type> services start <service_id> --json
```

Then execute the exact `next.command` returned by each step. It may invoke a capability, ask for a selection, create a Checkout, wait for human action, return an Agent-visible result, or read a protected result after grant.

`services start` creates the Execution and returns the preferred capability plus its `required_input`. Put business values only in repeated `--input key=value` options on the returned `services invoke`, `services quote`, or `services checkout` command. For example, a company keyword belongs in `--input keyword=美团`; it never belongs in `--target`.

Rules:

- One independent service intent uses one Service Execution.
- Every candidate list belongs to its source Service Execution. After a human selects a rank, submit the selection on that same Execution; never copy it into a new Execution or construct a candidate.
- A normal single-Execution paid step uses the exact `services checkout` command returned by the CLI, but only after the instruction has made the price visible and the human explicitly agrees. The command internally uses the same Quote, Cart and Checkout rules.
- `services quote -> cart add --quote -> buy --cart` is only for a human who explicitly asks to combine Quotes from multiple independent Executions. Never use it as a fallback when `services checkout` fails.
- Ask for required email/contact fields; explain their delivery purpose and never invent them.
- When Checkout is ready, make the amount, ItPay QR/image and URL visible on the current human surface, then stop. Do not query until the human completes the action or asks for status.
- Normal payment happens on the ItPay Checkout page. `itpay pay` and `buy --pay` are operator escape hatches.
- Payment is confirmed only by Backend Checkout or Order state.
- Agent-visible results come from `services next`; do not call `read-result` for them.
- Quota exhaustion, candidate selection, Checkout pending, payment verified and delivery each remain on the same Execution. Never create a replacement Execution to escape one of those states.
- An Execution may have delivery history; always follow `services next` for the backend-selected current delivery instead of reusing an older result.
- Protected results require a current human grant. The grant is scoped to one delivery, approved fields and frozen Agent audience, and expires after 15 minutes.
- A pending refund locks every delivery path and revokes existing grants.

## Recovery

Before creating anything again:

```bash
itpay --agent-type <agent_type> next --json
itpay --agent-type <agent_type> services list --json
itpay --agent-type <agent_type> services next <service_execution_id> --json
itpay --agent-type <agent_type> services checkout <service_execution_id> --resume --json
itpay --agent-type <agent_type> checkout --id <checkout_id> --token <display_token> --json
itpay --agent-type <agent_type> refund get <refund_request_id> --json
itpay --agent-type <agent_type> device recover --confirm-backend-reset --json
```

## Safety

- Never invent service, capability, item, Checkout, Order, grant, or refund IDs.
- Never expose Provider credentials, raw payloads, display tokens as standalone chat data, Buyer bearer tokens, or Device private keys.
- Never bypass ownership, compatibility, quota, grant, or refund-lock errors.
- Do not use `services events` in a normal flow; it is a bounded redacted diagnostic command.
- Do not rotate Agent Type or local identity to reset free quota.
